# Changelog

All notable changes to PurpleIRC are recorded here. The bundle's
`CFBundleShortVersionString` is derived automatically from the git commit
count (`1.0.<count>`); CHANGELOG entries use the same scheme so the
version on the About panel matches the entry that introduced it.

## [1.0.101] — 2026-05-01

### Added (Phase 8 — Visual polish)

- **Animated network state dot** in the sidebar Networks section.
  Pulses (1.0× ↔ 1.3× scale) while the connection is in
  `.connecting`. A soft blurred halo glows behind the dot while
  `.connected`. Both effects suppressed under
  `accessibilityReduceMotion` so motion-sensitive users still get
  the static colour cue without the animation.
- **Hover halo on chat rows** — `MessageRow` gains a 4% primary
  overlay when hovering, layered above the existing
  highlight/mention/watch-hit background so loud rows still take
  precedence. Suppressed under reduce-motion.
- **Density-aware row padding wired in** — `MessageRow` now reads
  `chatDensity.rowPadding / 2` as the vertical padding baseline,
  with the existing `relaxedRowSpacing` toggle stacking on top so
  accessibility-conscious users can combine both. Compact ≈ 0.5 pt,
  Cozy ≈ 1.5 pt, Comfortable ≈ 3 pt.
- **Subtle gradient on the buffer header title** —
  `LinearGradient(.primary → .primary.opacity(0.7))` from top to
  bottom. Adds depth without compromising legibility on either
  light or dark themes.

### Changed

- `MessageRow` now consumes `Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)`
  in two places (hover halo, animation). When new visual effects
  land, follow the same pattern.

## [1.0.100] — 2026-05-01

### Added (Phase 7 — Encrypted blob attachment store)

- **`BlobStore` actor (new file)** — encrypted file-attachment
  storage at `<supportDir>/blobs/<uuid>.bin`. Each payload sealed
  via the keystore-derived DEK through `EncryptedJSON.safeWrite`;
  metadata index at `blobs/index.json`. Mirrors the LogStore
  pattern (single off-main actor, set-key push, encrypted
  envelope). Init inlines the index load — calling actor-isolated
  `loadIndex()` from init triggers a Swift 6 isolation
  diagnostic.
- **`BlobStore.BlobRecord`** — Codable on-disk metadata (id,
  filename, contentType, sizeBytes, createdAt, attachedTo).
- **`BlobStore.AttachmentRef`** — lightweight (id, filename,
  contentType, sizeBytes) inlined on owners (`AddressEntry
  .attachments` today; future channels / messages later) so the
  editor renders lists without round-tripping through the store.
  The store is the source of truth for the bytes; inline refs
  are a denormalised view.
- **API surface**: `store(data:filename:contentType:attachedTo:)`,
  `store(fileURL:attachedTo:)` (auto-guesses MIME via UTType),
  `read(_:)`, `delete(_:)`, `writeToTempFile(_:)` (materialises
  to `~/tmp/PurpleIRC-blobs/` for Open / Reveal handoffs to
  NSWorkspace), `setEncryptionKey(_:)` (reloads index when
  key transitions).
- **Why a separate store rather than inline like profile photos?**
  Photos are tiny (~10 KB). Documents are routinely 5+ MB.
  Inlining 5 MB of base64 in `settings.json` forces every save
  to rewrite the whole encrypted envelope and every load to
  decrypt it. The blob store keeps `settings.json` small —
  only the metadata lives there — and pays the encrypt /
  decrypt cost only when the user opens the attachment.
- **`AddressEntry.attachments`** — new array; `decodeIfPresent`
  for backward compat.
- **`ChatModel.blobStore: BlobStore`** — initialised against the
  support directory; receives keystore-key pushes via the same
  `pushKeyToLogStore` path that feeds the seen / session-history /
  bot stores.
- **AddressEntryEditor → new "Attachments" section** between
  Contact and Notes:
  - "Attach file…" button (NSOpenPanel, multi-select, no type
    filter — any file is fair game).
  - Drop target accepting file URLs from Finder, routed through
    the same store path.
  - **`AttachmentRow`** view: SF Symbol icon resolved from MIME
    prefix (`image/*` → photo, `video/*` → film, `audio/*` →
    music.note, `text/*` → doc.text, `pdf` → doc.richtext, `zip`
    → archivebox, `json`/`xml` → curlybraces, otherwise → doc),
    filename + contentType + ByteCountFormatter size, three
    buttons: Open (NSWorkspace.open via temp file), Reveal
    (Finder reveal via temp file), Remove (drops both the inline
    ref AND the blob-store payload).
- **`/nuke` already covered** — `NukeService.wipeSupportDirectory`
  enumerated `blobs/` in its subtree list back in Phase 1
  (forward-compat), so attachments wipe cleanly with no
  NukeService change this round.

## [1.0.99] — 2026-05-01

### Added (Phase 6 — Address book profile photos)

- **`AddressEntry.photoData: Data?`** — optional inline JPEG bytes,
  decoded with `decodeIfPresent` for backward compat. Storage round-
  trips through the existing encrypted-settings envelope, so photos
  inherit the keystore-derived AES-GCM seal alongside contact notes.
- **`PhotoUtilities` module (new file)** — downscaling pipeline
  (`maxDimension = 256` px on the longest side, JPEG re-encode at
  quality 0.85), `loadDownscaled(from:)` / `downscaleAndEncode(_:)`
  helpers, `initials(for:)` (first alphanumeric, uppercased, "?"
  fallback), and `avatarTint(for:)` (deterministic Color from
  SHA-256 hash of the lowercased nick → palette of 11) so the
  same nick always lands on the same swatch.
- **`ContactAvatar` view** — single configuration knob (`size` in
  points). Renders the entry's photo when present (Image
  scaledToFill + Circle clip) or a tinted-gradient circle with
  the deterministic initial. Initials font auto-scales at ~46% of
  size; 0.5 px outer stroke at primary.opacity(0.08) for definition
  against any background.
- **`ContactAvatarByNick`** — convenience wrapper that resolves a
  nick against `settings.addressBook` (case-insensitive). When no
  match exists, synthesises an empty entry so the placeholder
  still renders the deterministic tint + initial. Nicks not yet
  in the address book share the visual identity.
- **AddressEntryEditor → new Photo section at top:** 72-pt avatar
  preview, "Choose photo…" button (NSOpenPanel filtered to `.image`),
  Remove button when one is set, plus a drop target accepting both
  `.image` (raw bitmap from another app) and `.fileURL` (Finder
  drag) — both resolve through PhotoUtilities so the inline
  storage invariant holds regardless of source.
- **Sidebar Contacts row** now leads with a 22-pt `ContactAvatar`
  overlaid with the existing presence dot in the bottom-right
  corner (haloed with a 1.5 px stroke against the control
  background so the dot reads against any avatar tint). Identity
  + presence both visible without enlarging the row.

## [1.0.98] — 2026-05-01

### Added (Phase 5 — Fonts: per-element slots + advanced typography)

- **`FontStyle` data model** (new file `FontStyle.swift`) — sparse
  Codable container with "inherit" sentinels on every field
  (empty `family`, zero `size`, `.inherit` weight, nil `italic` /
  `ligatures` / `tracking` / `lineHeightMultiple`). Walks an
  inheritance chain so a slot can override only what it cares about
  while everything else falls back to its parent.
- **`ResolvedFont`** — materialised concrete-value bag the renderer
  reads (family, size, weight, italic, ligaturesEnabled, tracking,
  lineHeightMultiple, plus `isBuiltInMonoToken` / `isBuiltInPropToken`
  flags so the SwiftUI Font factory routes to `.system(...)` vs
  `.custom(...)` correctly).
- **Four `FontSlot`s** on `AppSettings` — `chatBodyFont`, `nickFont`,
  `timestampFont`, `systemLineFont`, all defaulting to pure inherit
  so old `settings.json` files render unchanged. The chat-body slot
  inherits from the legacy `chatFontFamily` / `chatFontSize` /
  `boldChatText` fields.
- **`ChatModel.font(for: FontSlot) -> ResolvedFont`** — single resolver
  every renderer reads. `chatFont` now goes through it; `chatCaptionFont`
  honours the system-line slot and recomposes at 78% the slot's
  configured size.
- **`View.purpleFont(_:)` modifier** — applies SwiftUI Font + tracking
  + lineSpacing in one call so call sites don't reimplement the
  `(multiplier - 1.0) * size` line-spacing math.
- **`purpleText(_:_:)` helper** — wraps a string in an
  `AttributedString` with `.ligature = 0` when the resolved font has
  ligatures off, since SwiftUI's `Text` doesn't expose a ligature
  toggle on macOS.
- **`InstalledFonts` cache** — `NSFontManager.shared.availableFontFamilies`
  fetched once at first use, plus a monospaced-only subset filtered
  via `NSFontManager.traits(of:).contains(.fixedPitchFontMask)`.
- **`FontFamilyPickerSheet`** — searchable list of every installed
  family (~500 on a typical Mac), with a "Monospaced only" toggle
  (defaults ON when picking for the chat body). Each row renders the
  family name + "AaBb 123" sample in that family so users pick by
  visual feedback rather than guessing from PostScript names.
- **Fonts tab rebuilt** — three sections:
  - **Chat font (root)**: legacy enum picker + "Pick installed font…"
    button that overrides the enum at resolve time, plus a "Clear"
    affordance to drop back. Size slider, bold toggle, /font slash-
    command pointer.
  - **Chat body — advanced**: ligatures, tracking (-2 → +4 pt),
    line-height (0.8× → 2.0×), weight, italic.
  - **Per-element overrides**: collapsible DisclosureGroups for Nick /
    Timestamp / System-line slots. Each has its own family picker,
    size slider with an "inherit" sentinel at 0 pt, weight, italic,
    ligatures, tracking, and line-height. Everything inherits from
    the chat body unless overridden.

## [1.0.97] — 2026-05-01

### Added (Phase 4 — Theme system: UserTheme + per-event colors + WYSIWYG builder)

- **`UserTheme` model** in `SoundsAndThemes.swift` — Codable struct
  mirroring `Theme`'s shape with hex strings for every color slot,
  plus a sparse `kindOverrideHex: [String: String]` map keyed by
  `ChatLineKindTag.rawValue` for per-event overrides. `materialised`
  produces a runtime `Theme`; `kindOverridesMaterialised` produces
  the typed `[Tag: Color]` dict. `UserTheme.duplicate(of:name:)`
  snapshots a built-in or user theme as the starting point.
- **`ChatLineKindTag` enum** — 14 stable string tags (info, error,
  privmsg, privmsgSelf, action, notice, join, part, quit, nick,
  topic, raw, mention, watchlist) so per-event overrides survive
  Codable round-trips and rename-resilient over time.
- **`Theme.resolve(id:userThemes:)`** — built-ins win on id collision,
  then user themes by uuid, then `.classic` fallback.
- **`AppSettings.userThemes: [UserTheme]`** — persisted alongside
  `themeID`.
- **`ServerProfile.themeOverrideID: String?`** — per-network theme
  override, decoded with `decodeIfPresent` so old `settings.json`
  files don't fail.
- **`ChatModel.theme`** rewritten to consult
  `activeConnection.profile.themeOverrideID` first, then
  `settings.themeID`, both via the resolver.
- **`ChatModel.kindColor(for:)`** — overlay lookup; nil means
  "inherit", letting MessageRow fall back to the typed slot
  (`infoColor`, `joinColor`, etc.).
- **MessageRow rewired** — every kind (info, error, privmsg, action,
  notice, join, part, quit, nick, topic, raw, motd) reads
  `model.kindColor(for: tag) ?? theme.someColor`, so a UserTheme
  paints each event independently.
- **`ThemeBuilderView` (new file)** — WYSIWYG sheet with HSplitView:
  editor on the left (Theme name; Surface bg/fg; Per-event base
  palette; Backgrounds; 8-slot Nick palette; Per-event color
  overrides with + to add and ↺ to drop), live preview on the
  right (15 sample rows covering every kind a UserTheme can
  repaint, painted against the draft's `chatBackground` /
  `chatForeground`). Save / Save As / Delete / Export to
  `.purpletheme` JSON via `NSSavePanel`.
- **`ThemeImporter.importTheme(from:into:)`** — reads a `.purpletheme`
  file, decodes UserTheme, fresh-stamps UUID + createdAt so multiple
  imports don't collide, appends to `settings.userThemes`.
- **Themes tab rebuilt** — new "Custom themes" section above the
  built-in grids: per-row swatch tile, name + basedOn caption,
  Use / Edit / Duplicate / Delete affordances. Plus "+ New theme"
  (snapshots active theme and opens the builder) and "Import…"
  (NSOpenPanel → ThemeImporter).
- **ServerEditor → Theme override picker** — "Use global theme"
  sentinel, divided list of built-ins and user themes, persisted via
  `themeOverrideID`.
- **`/theme` command refactored** into a real subcommand parser:
  - `/theme` — list built-ins + user themes + show current
  - `/theme <id-or-name>` — switch (handles uuid prefix matching)
  - `/theme builder` (also `edit`, `new`) — open the WYSIWYG sheet
  - `/theme import <path>` — load a `.purpletheme` file
  - `/theme export <user-theme-name-or-id> <path>` — write to disk
- **`ChatModel.themeBuilderDraft` + `themeBuilderIsNew`** —
  `@Published` state surfaced by ContentView via
  `.sheet(item: $model.themeBuilderDraft)` so the slash command and
  the Setup tab share one presentation path.

## [1.0.96] — 2026-05-01

### Documentation

Captured Phases 1–3 in CHANGELOG / HANDOFF / README. No code change.

## [1.0.95] — 2026-05-01

### Changed (Phase 3 — Setup reorganization)

- **Setup sidebar regrouped into 6 sections × 20 tabs** (was 3 × 11),
  mirroring the macOS System Settings layout so adding more in later
  phases doesn't crowd anything:
  - **Connections** — Servers, Identities, Proxy & DCC *(new)*
  - **People & places** — Address Book, Channels, Ignore, Highlights
  - **Behavior** — Behavior, Notifications *(new)*, Logging *(new)*
  - **Personalization** — Appearance, Themes *(new)*, Fonts *(new)*,
    Sounds *(new)*
  - **Power-user** — Bot, PurpleBot, Assistant *(new)*,
    Shortcuts & Aliases *(new)*, Backup *(new)*
  - **Security** — Security
- **Behavior** trimmed to its functional core (Quit, Session restore,
  CTCP, Away) with a "where to find moved settings" pointer block.
- **Appearance** trimmed to meta-knobs (Timestamp, Density picker,
  Bold / Relaxed / Collapse toggles); a new Density picker is wired
  to `settings.chatDensity` and matches the View → Density submenu
  added in 1.0.94.
- **Notifications** consolidates every alert channel (sound / dock /
  banner) for watchlist hits and own-nick mentions into one tab,
  rather than scattering them across Behavior + Appearance + Highlights.
- **Logging** lifts persistent-log toggles, retention, and the legacy
  plaintext conversion path out of Behavior so a user worried about
  disk usage or compliance has one tab to audit.
- **Themes / Fonts / Sounds** promoted from sections to their own tabs
  so they have room to grow into the Theme Builder (Phase 4) and
  custom font picker (Phase 5).
- **Shortcuts & Aliases** is the home for `userAliases` (list / add /
  remove); ships with built-in keyboard-shortcut documentation, with
  user-customizable shortcuts deferred.
- **Backup** surfaces `BackupSettingsRow` + `FactoryResetRow` plus a
  pointer to the `/nuke` destructive reset.

## [1.0.94] — 2026-05-01

### Added (Phase 2 — Full macOS menu system)

- **8 native menus** replace the single "IRC" menu, each backed by a
  small private View struct so `App.body`'s `.commands` block stays
  scannable.
  - **File** — New Network… (⌘N), Close Buffer (⌘W), Export Current
    Buffer…, Export All Buffers…
  - **PurpleIRC** (after Settings…) — Lock Keystore (⇧⌘L), Reset
    Everything (NUKE)…
  - **Edit** (after Pasteboard) — Find in Buffer… (⌘F)
  - **View** — Show Raw Log toggle, Increase / Decrease / Reset Font
    Size (⌘= / ⌘- / ⌘0), Density submenu (Compact / Cozy /
    Comfortable), Theme submenu (every `Theme.all` entry, with a
    checkmark on the current selection)
  - **Buffer** — Next / Previous Buffer (⌘⌥→/←), Next / Previous
    Network (⌘⌥↓/↑), Mark All as Read (⌃⌘M), Clear Buffer
  - **Network** — Connect (⌘K), Disconnect (⇧⌘D), Reconnect (⇧⌘R),
    Channel List… (⇧⌘L), Watchlist… (⇧⌘A — moved from ⇧⌘W since
    that's the system "Close Window"), Watch Monitor… (⇧⌘M),
    DCC Transfers… (⇧⌘T), Seen Log…
  - **Conversation** — Join Channel… (⇧⌘J), Open Query… (⇧⌘Q),
    Set Topic…, Invite User…, WHOIS…, WHOWAS…
  - **Help** (after system Help) — Slash Command Reference… (⇧⌘?),
    App Diagnostic Log…, Chat Logs…
- **Menu state derives from live model state** (active connection
  presence, connection state, current buffer kind) so menu items
  reflect what's possible without manual refreshes.
- **Theme + Density submenus generate from `Theme.all` /
  `ChatDensity.allCases`**, so adding a theme picks up automatically.
- **Generic `InputPromptSheet`** backed by `ChatModel.inputPrompt`
  for menu-driven dialogs (Set Topic, Join Channel, Open Query,
  Invite, WHOIS, WHOWAS) — one sheet, many uses, instead of a forest
  of one-off modals.

### Added (model surface for menus)

- `ChatModel.reconnect()` → `IRCConnection.handleReconnectFromMenu()`
- `ChatModel.cycleNetwork(forward:)`
- `ChatModel.clearCurrentBuffer()`, `markAllReadEverywhere()`,
  `cycleBuffer(forward:)`
- `ChatModel.incrementFontSize()` / `decrementFontSize()` / `resetFontSize()`
- `ChatModel.setTheme(byID:)` / `setDensity(_:)`
- `ChatModel.requestInput(...)` wrapper around the new
  `InputPrompt` struct.

## [1.0.93] — 2026-05-01

### Added (Phase 1 — Slash command surface + `/nuke`)

- **`/nuke`** — two-step destructive reset. Routes through
  `NukeService` which disconnects every network, locks the keystore,
  wipes `settings.json` + `keystore.json` + every encrypted subtree
  (`channels/`, `history/`, `scripts/`, `seen/`, `logs/`, `downloads/`,
  `backups/`, `blobs/`, `photos/`, `app.log`), clears every Keychain
  item under `com.purpleirc`, then quits. Sanity rail refuses to run
  if `supportDirectoryURL` doesn't look like an Application Support /
  `.config` path. The confirmation sheet (`NukeConfirmationSheet`)
  enumerates exactly what will be wiped and disables the destructive
  button until the user types the literal phrase **NUKE**.
- **21 new model-level slash commands**: `/clear` (`/cls`), `/find`
  (`/search`), `/markread` (`/markallread`), `/next` (`/nextbuffer`),
  `/prev` (`/previous`, `/prevbuffer`), `/goto` (`/switch`),
  `/network`, `/theme`, `/font`, `/density`, `/zoom`, `/timestamp`
  (`/ts`), `/lock`, `/backup`, `/export`, `/alias`, `/repeat`,
  `/timer`, `/summary`, `/translate`.
- **11 new connection-level slash commands**: `/reconnect`, `/rejoin`
  (`/cycle`), `/invite`, `/knock`, `/motd`, `/lusers`, `/admin`,
  `/info`, `/version`, `/silence`, `/unsilence`.
- **User-defined aliases** (`AppSettings.userAliases`). Resolved
  *before* built-in commands so the user can shadow built-ins on
  purpose. Editable inline via `/alias <name> <expansion>` and
  `/alias -<name>`, or in the new Setup → Shortcuts & Aliases tab.
- **`ChatDensity` enum** (`.compact` / `.cozy` / `.comfortable`)
  with a `.cozy` default, plus an integrated row-padding
  multiplier consumed at draw time.
- **`AppSettings.viewZoom`** — 0.5–2.0 multiplier on top of the
  configured chat font size, switchable live with `/zoom`.

### Changed

- **`CommandCatalog` synced**. Every working command (the new ones
  plus the existing-but-hidden `/watch`, `/unwatch`, `/dcc`, `/log`,
  `/logs`, `/assist`, `/reloadbots`, etc.) is now an entry, so they
  show in `/`-autocomplete and the `/help` sheet. Categories grew
  from 8 to 15 (Connection, Channels, Messages, Identity, Moderation,
  User lookup, Server info, DCC, Window & buffer, Appearance, Logs,
  Bot, Automation, Dangerous, App) so the list stays scannable.
- **`BufferView` body extracted into a `BufferViewObservers` modifier**
  to keep Swift's "expression too complex" type-checker happy after
  `/find` and `/clear` bridges joined the existing focus-restore
  observers. Behaviourally identical.
- **`IRCConnection` gained four buffer helpers**: `clearBufferLines(id:)`,
  `markAllBuffersRead()`, `cycleBuffer(forward:)`, and
  `selectBufferByName(_:)` (exact > prefix > contains match).

## [1.0.92] — 2026-04-30

### Security

- **CRLF injection blocked at every outbound seam.** `IRCSanitize.field`
  scrubs CR / LF / NUL from script-supplied and AppleScript-supplied
  fields (`target`, `text`, `chan`, `reason`, `body`) before they reach
  the IRC line assembler, and `IRCSanitize.line` re-scrubs the assembled
  line at `IRCClient.send` as defence in depth. Without this, an
  AppleScript like `send message "hi\r\nQUIT :pwn" to "#x"` (or a
  PurpleBot `irc.msg(target, text)` with embedded newlines) could
  smuggle a second IRC command after the message body. Affected sites:
  `AppleScriptCommands.swift` (Send / Join / Part / Say), `BotHost.swift`
  (`irc.send`, `irc.sendActive`, `irc.msg`, `irc.notice`), and
  `IRCClient.send` / `IRCClient.sendSync`.
- **Credentials masked in raw log + AppLog.** `IRCSanitize.maskForDisplay`
  rewrites `PASS <pw>`, `AUTHENTICATE <b64>` (control markers `+` / `*`
  preserved), and `PRIVMSG NickServ :IDENTIFY [acct] <pw>` to `****` in
  both the outbound raw-log path and the inbound echo path (echo-message
  cap can replay our own IDENTIFY back to us). Wire bytes are unchanged.
- **DCC listener bound to the advertised IP.** The active-DCC listener
  (`DCC.swift`) used to bind `0.0.0.0`, letting any host that could
  route to the listening port race the legitimate peer to grab the
  file/chat. The listener now binds to the same IP we advertise in the
  `DCC SEND` / `DCC CHAT` offer, with a wildcard fallback only when the
  bind fails (LAN-only setups whose advertised address can't be bound).
- **DCC filename hardening.** `sanitizeFilename` now strips control
  bytes (≤0x1F + 0x7F) and `\` / `/` / `:`, collapses `..` segments,
  takes only the last path component, drops leading dots (hidden files),
  caps at 255 chars, and rejects collapse-to-empty / dot-only names
  with a `dcc-file` fallback.
- **POSIX `0600` perms on every encrypted-at-rest file.**
  `EncryptedJSON.safeWrite` and `KeyStore.persist` set owner-only file
  modes after the atomic write. The contents are already AES-GCM
  sealed when a DEK is in hand, but tightening the file mode protects
  unencrypted-mode users (whose JSON would otherwise inherit the
  user's umask, typically `0644`).
- **Full SHA-256 for the keystore Keychain account.** Previously
  truncated to a 6-byte (48-bit) prefix, which made colliding-path
  attacks plausible (~2²⁴ expected attempts). The Keychain account
  name is no longer length-constrained, so there's no reason to
  truncate.
- **PurpleBot script integrity hash.** `BotScript` now carries a
  `contentHash` (SHA-256 hex) captured at write time and verified
  before the source is handed to JavaScriptCore. Disk-tampered or
  partially-decrypted scripts surface as a script-log error instead of
  silently executing.
- **HTTP CONNECT proxy parser tightened.** Now requires a literal
  `HTTP/1.x` version line, a strict `200` status, refuses any
  `Content-Length: N` (`N > 0`) — which would smuggle bytes the tunnel
  would otherwise mistake for application data — and caps response
  headers at 16 KiB so a hostile proxy can't grow the accumulator
  forever.
- **SASL PLAIN AUTHENTICATE chunked at 400 bytes** (`SASLNegotiator
  .chunkedAuthenticate`). Long credentials would previously produce a
  single `AUTHENTICATE <b64>` line over the 512-byte IRC limit and
  silently fail SASL. Multi-chunk payloads end with `AUTHENTICATE +`
  per spec.
- **`IRCMessage.parse` rejects lines containing NUL.** Server-supplied
  nick / channel / target fields can no longer carry forbidden bytes
  into buffer keys or file slugs.

### Fixed

- **Reconnect Task lifecycle race.** The delayed reconnect now captures
  the connection's UUID and re-checks `Task.isCancelled`,
  `userInitiatedDisconnect`, and the connection state inside
  `MainActor.run`. Without this, a disconnect issued during the backoff
  sleep (or a manual reconnect that already started a new attempt)
  could trigger a phantom reconnect on top.
- **433 nick collision now bounded.** Capped at 4 retries with state
  reset on `001` welcome and on each fresh `connect()`. The previous
  loop appended `_` forever, eventually tripping `NICKLEN` and
  cascading 432/433 with no path to registration.
- **Watchlist alert dedupe window.** Per-nick `lastAlertAt` timestamp
  suppresses duplicate banners when MONITOR / ISON / observed-activity
  fire for the same sighting in the same instant. 3-second window;
  manual test alerts skip the gate.
- **`lastAwayReplyAt` no longer grows without bound.** Long-running
  connections in busy networks would otherwise accumulate one entry
  per unique sender forever. Entries older than the throttle window
  are pruned when the dict exceeds 1024 keys.
- **Restore-buffer selection is deterministic.** Replaces the
  fire-and-forget 800 ms Task that left a blank pane on screen when
  JOIN took longer than expected. The desired buffer name is captured
  in `pendingRestoreSelectName` and `indexOfOrCreateBuffer` resolves it
  the moment a matching buffer materializes.
- **`closeBuffer` selects the next buffer before mutating the array.**
  Eliminates the one-frame placeholder render that used to flash when
  closing the active buffer.
- **`SessionHistoryStore.load` trims each buffer to `linesPerBuffer`
  immediately after decode.** Defensive against a tampered or bloated
  history file blowing up memory at restore time.
- **BATCH bracket safety.** `openBatches` is capped at 256 entries
  (warns + evicts oldest beyond that), duplicate `+id` overwrites log
  a warning, and the dict (plus `chatHistoryFetched`) clears on
  disconnect / failed so reconnects don't see ghosts.
- **IRCv3 dangling backslash preserved.** A tag value ending in `\`
  is malformed per spec; preserving the backslash makes a buggy
  server's behaviour visible instead of silently truncating the
  value.

### Changed

- **Buffer scrollback (`5000` lines) emits a one-shot info notice on
  first overflow.** No longer silent; the user sees `— Scrollback
  exceeded 5000 lines; older history is being trimmed —` once per
  buffer per session.
- **Message-box focus is restored on every modal-sheet dismissal.**
  Sheet dismissal doesn't fire `NSWindow.didBecomeKey` (the same
  window stays key), so the existing app-activate / window-activate
  refocus path missed it. Added `.onChange(of:)` handlers for
  `model.showSetup` / `showHelp` / `showWatchlist` / `showDCC` /
  `showChannelList` / `showSeenList` / `showRawLog` / `showAppLog` /
  `showChatLogs` and the local multi-line editor sheet, plus a
  `refocusInput()` call when the Find bar closes. App-activate,
  window-activate, buffer-switch, and scene-phase paths were already
  wired correctly.

### Verified — no change required

These items were flagged in the security/correctness review but turned
out to be already correct on inspection; recorded here so future
reviews don't re-litigate them.

- TLS validation: `NWParameters(tls: .init())` enables certificate
  and hostname validation by default on Apple platforms; no
  override is in effect.
- Per-connection Combine subscribers: the `IRCConnection` instance
  persists across disconnect/reconnect, and its subscribers are
  intentionally long-lived. `removeConnection` releases everything
  together.
- Highlight + trigger regex validation: `HighlightRuleEditor` and
  `TriggerRuleEditor` already display compile errors inline as
  orange caption text under the field.
- Proxy credentials: `proxyPassword` already routes through the
  `persistCredentials` Keychain-backed pipeline.
- SOCKS5 user/pass length: `sendSOCKS5UserPass` and
  `sendSOCKS5Connect` already enforce the 255-byte field limit and
  `fail()` gracefully on overflow.

### Tests

164 tests across 12 suites all pass (`swift test` / `./run-tests.sh`).
The build (`./build-app.sh`) produces `PurpleIRC.app` bundled with the
git-derived version stamps in Info.plist.
