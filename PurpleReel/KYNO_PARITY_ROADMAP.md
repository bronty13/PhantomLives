# Kyno Parity Roadmap

Living checklist of Kyno-visible features that PurpleReel doesn't yet
match. Built from user-supplied Kyno screenshots + the Kyno
[keyboard shortcuts](https://support.lesspain.software/support/solutions/articles/12000010141-keyboard-shortcuts)
reference. Order within each section is roughly by user-impact and
implementation cost.

Legend: ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⬜ open · ❌ explicitly skipped

## Browser toolbar

| Status | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Drilldown toggle | Toolbar pill |
| ✅ | Type filter chips (All / Video / Audio / Images) | Capsule buttons |
| ✅ | Sort dropdown (Name / Date / Size / Duration / FPS) | `@AppStorage` |
| ✅ | Name filter (search field) | |
| ✅ | View mode toggle (Grid / List / Detail) | 3-icon segmented control bound to ⌘1/⌘2/⌘3 |

| 🟡 | **Filter** advanced dropdown (Size / Date / Folder / Rating / Tag / Duration / Audio codec / Video codec / Resolution / Frame rate / Spanning / FCP X) | Multi-criteria predicate builder shipped: Rating / Tag / Video Codec / Resolution / Frame Rate / Size / Duration. Pills bar + UserDefaults persistence. **TODO**: Audio codec, Date Modified/Recorded, Folder scope, Spanning, FCP X library predicate. |
| ✅ | Back / Forward navigation arrows + ⌘[/⌘] | History stack of folder selections; History menu |
| ✅ | Drilldown as button (not toggle) — toggles drilldown for the *currently-selected folder* only | Per-folder set in AppState; toolbar button acts on selection |
| ✅ | Sort direction triangle | Asc/Desc toggle in sort menu, persisted via `sortAscending` |

---

## Browser views

| Status | View | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | List view (table with thumbnail / name / codec / res / fps / duration / size) | |
| 🟡 | Thumbnail (grid) view | LazyVGrid tiles with selection ring + transcode-progress overlay; **TODO**: thumbnail size slider |
| ✅ | Single-clip Detail view | `ClipDetailInline` — player + metadata pane; ⌘1/⌘2/⌘3 switches mode |
| 🟡 | Extra columns: Date Modified, Date Created, Date Recorded, Display size, Aspect ratio, Rating, Frame rate (visible), Title, Description, Reel/Scene/Shot/Take/Angle, Camera | Rating / Date Modified / Title / Description / Reel/Scene/Shot/Take/Angle/Camera done via `ListColumn` toolbar menu (Table cap = 3 optional at a time); **TODO**: Date Created, Date Recorded, Display size, Aspect ratio |

---

## Detail right pane (currently Content / Tracks / Log)

| Status | Tab | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Content | Metadata block + 30-frame grid |
| ✅ | Tracks | Per-track technical breakdown |
| 🟡 | Log → Markers / Subclips / Tags / Rating | Functional; should split into separate tabs like Kyno (Metadata / Subclips). |
| ✅ | **Metadata** dedicated tab with: Title, Description, Rating, Reel, Scene, Shot, Take, Angle, Camera, Tags | `MetadataPaneView`; v2 migration shipped as separate `clip_metadata` table. Markers still live in Log tab. |
| ⬜ | Subclips as own tab with Start / End / Title columns | Currently lives inside the Log pane |

---

## Player

| Status | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Play / pause | Space |
| ✅ | Frame step ←/→ | |
| ✅ | Multi-rate J/L shuttle | NB: Kyno uses J/L as 5-second jumps instead (different convention). Worth offering both as a setting. |
| ✅ | I / O mark in/out | |
| ✅ | M add marker | |
| ✅ | S save subclip from I/O | |
| ✅ | View menu (Rotate 0/90/180/270, Flip H/V) | |
| ✅ | LUT loader | |
| ✅ | Audio waveform overlay | |
| ✅ | Multi-rate shuttle | |
| 🟡 | **5-second jumps**: Shift+Arrow or alternate J/L mode | Shift+← / Shift+→ shipped; alternate J/L mode (Kyno's default) still on the Preferences backlog |
| ✅ | **Up/Down arrows** = jump to next/previous marker or in/out | `PlayerController.seekToAnchor(direction:markerTimes:)` — union of markers + I/O |
| ✅ | **Alt+Space** = play in→out | Wired via menu + PlayerCommand.playInToOut |
| ✅ | **Cmd+L** = toggle loop mode | `PlayerController.loopMode` + didPlayToEnd observer |
| ✅ | **Cmd+F** = full-screen toggle | `NSWindow.toggleFullScreen` |
| ✅ | **Cmd+Shift+E** = export current frame | `PlayerController.exportCurrentFrame()` w/ save panel |
| ⬜ | **Cmd+R / Cmd+Alt+R** = rotate right/left | Already have in View menu; bind as menu shortcuts |
| ⬜ | **Alt+M** / **Alt+S** = remove marker / subclip | |
| ⬜ | **Zebra filter** (Ctrl+Alt+E) | Metal/CIFilter: highlight pixels > threshold |
| ⬜ | **Widescreen mattes** (Ctrl+Alt+W) | Black bars at 2.39:1 or 1.85:1 |
| ⬜ | Aspect-fit / actual-size / fit-window zoom controls | "Fit: 52%" stepper in Kyno's toolbar |
| ✅ | Loop-mode UI | Orange `repeat.circle.fill` button in transport bar |

---

## Sidebar (left)

| Status | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Folder tree with drilldown | |
| ✅ | **Workspace section** (multiple rooted folders) | "Add Folder to Workspace…" (⌘I) / "Clear Workspace…" gear menu, per-root context menu |
| ✅ | **Devices section** | Enumerates `/Volumes/*`; boot-volume firmlink resolved to `/` so its prefix matches catalogued paths |
| ⬜ | Sidebar collapsible sections (Workspace / Devices) | Disclosure caret on each section header |
| ✅ | Sidebar settings gear menu (workspace mgmt) | Top-right gear in Workspace header |

---

## Metadata schema

Schema migration `v2_clip_metadata` — **shipped** as a separate
`clip_metadata` table (1:1 with `asset`, FK cascade) so the
scanner-owned `asset` table stays tightly scoped to technical
columns. Edits commit on Return / focus loss from the Metadata pane.

| Status | Column | Type |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | `title` | text |
| ✅ | `reel` | text |
| ✅ | `scene` | text |
| ✅ | `shot` | text |
| ✅ | `take` | text |
| ✅ | `angle` | text |
| ✅ | `camera` | text |
| ✅ | `description` | text (its own column in `clip_metadata`) |
| ✅ | `colorLabel` | text (on `rating` table) |

These flow through to FCPXML as `<metadata>` entries with `<md
key="Title" value="…"/>` style children, omitted entirely when no
field is populated.

## Preferences (currently: Backup / AI / About — Kyno has 6 panes)

| Status | Pane | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Backup | Already have |
| ✅ | AI | transcribe.py path, Whisper model, Ollama model |
| ✅ | About | |
| ⬜ | **General** — language (already comes via macOS), LUTs folder, Import LUTs from FCP, Import LUTs from Resolve, Apply detected LUTs to thumbnails | |
| ⬜ | **Tags** — user-defined tag library with Add / Remove / Import / Export | |

## Documentation (backlog)

External docs that ship alongside the app — every item should also be
reachable from the in-app Help menu so users don't have to leave the
window to find them.

| Status | Doc | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 🟡 | `USER_MANUAL.md` — full task-oriented user manual | Stub exists. Needs end-to-end coverage: workspace setup → catalog scan → browse / filter / multi-select → player + LUT → markers/subclips → metadata pane → Convert workflow → verified backup → SFTP delivery → FCPXML to FCP → AI features (Whisper / Ollama / Similar Takes) → preferences. Plus screenshots. |
| ✅ | `INSTALL.md` — install manual | **Shipped.** System requirements / two install paths (`.app` and source) / Gatekeeper bypass / TCC (Files & Folders / Full Disk Access) / auto-backup-on-launch / optional deps (ffmpeg / Whisper / Ollama / sshpass) / troubleshooting / file-system layout / uninstall. Opened via Help → Install & Setup. |
| ✅ | `SHORTCUTS.md` — keyboard shortcut cross-reference | **Generated** from `Sources/PurpleReel/Help/Shortcuts.swift` by `Scripts/generate-shortcuts-md.swift` (auto-run from `build-app.sh`). Single source-of-truth shared with the in-app cheat sheet — they can't drift. |
| ✅ | In-app **Help → User Manual** menu | Opens USER_MANUAL.md via `HelpDocs.open(.userManual)` (bundle → sibling-of-binary → repo path). |
| ✅ | In-app **Help → Keyboard Shortcuts** menu | `ShortcutsCheatSheet` sheet (⌘?). Searchable, grouped, reads `Shortcuts.all`. |
| ✅ | In-app **Help → Install & Setup** menu | Wired to open `INSTALL.md`; alerts politely until the doc itself ships. |
| ⬜ | Bundle docs into the `.app` | Ship `*.md` under `Contents/Resources/Help/`. `HelpDocs.open(...)` already checks the bundle first, so this is a project.yml-side change. |
| ⬜ | Help search-bar entries | macOS's standard Help menu has a search field. Populate it via `NSHelpManager` so users can type "drilldown" and jump to the relevant section. |

Implementation order suggestion:
1. **`SHORTCUTS.md`** first (smallest, derives directly from the
   roadmap's existing table) + ship a Help menu entry that opens it.
2. **`INSTALL.md`** second (also small; mostly already-known
   prerequisites).
3. **`USER_MANUAL.md`** expansion last — biggest single doc, benefits
   from referencing the other two.

Single-source-of-truth idea: keep the shortcut definitions in a Swift
file (`Help/Shortcuts.swift`) and *generate* both `SHORTCUTS.md` and
the in-app cheat-sheet from it at build time. Stops the doc / menu /
code drift problem that hits every keyboard-heavy app.

## Effort-buckets for the **remaining** open items

**Small** (1-2 hours each):
- 5-second jump (Shift+Arrow / alternate J/L mode in Preferences)
- Up/Down marker navigation
- Cmd+R / Cmd+Alt+R rotate shortcuts
- Alt+M / Alt+S remove marker / subclip
- Subclips own tab
- Sidebar collapsible sections (Workspace / Devices disclosure)
- `SHORTCUTS.md` extraction from this roadmap
- `INSTALL.md` consolidation (mostly exists in README + CLAUDE.md fragments)
- Thumbnail-size slider in grid view
- Markers in the Metadata tab (in addition to the Log tab)

**Medium** (half-day each):
- Filter advanced dropdown (multi-criteria builder: Size / Date /
  Rating / Tag / Codec / Resolution / Frame rate)
- Zebra + widescreen filter (CIFilter chain on the player)
- Aspect-fit / actual-size / fit-window zoom controls
- Preferences panes (General / Tags / Conversion / Devices / Transfer
  / Advanced) — split across several rounds
- In-app **Help → User Manual / Shortcuts / Install & Setup** menu
  entries + bundled Markdown renderer

**Large** (1+ day):
- Batch metadata edit sheet (Cmd+Shift+M) — apply tags / rating /
  log fields across the multi-selection
- LUT auto-detect from FCP / Resolve libraries
- USER_MANUAL.md full task-oriented rewrite with screenshots
- Shortcuts single-source-of-truth file + build-time generator (Swift
  → `SHORTCUTS.md` + in-app cheat-sheet)

**Explicitly skipped** (out of FCP-only scope):
- Avid Op-Atom MXF, RED R3D, P2, DNxHD non-rewrap — already declined in original build plan
- "Final Cut Pro X" advanced filter criterion — would require parsing FCP library state
