# Changelog

All notable changes to Epochs are recorded here.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-26

Initial scaffold + engine core.

### Added
- **Rules & data spec** (`docs/SPEC.md`): the full 7-epoch ruleset (turn loop,
  catch-up draft, expansion, combat dice system + odds table, structure
  reduction, monuments, presence/dominance/control area scoring with the
  complete per-epoch Victory-Point table, pre-eminence markers, event system),
  the TypeScript data model, the data-entry backlog, and the open rules
  questions to resolve against the source.
- **Project scaffold**: Electron 31 + Vite (electron-vite) + TypeScript, with a
  pure-TS engine under `src/shared/` (no Electron/DOM imports), Electron main +
  preload, a placeholder renderer that draws the VP table from the engine, and a
  vitest test harness.
- **Engine core**:
  - `combat.ts` — closed-form combat odds (`combatOdds`, `pmfMaxOfK`), seeded
    single-round and forted multi-round resolution.
  - `scoring.ts` — area control tiers (presence/dominance/control) and structure
    scoring against the VP table.
  - `rng.ts` — seeded deterministic RNG (mulberry32); the engine never calls
    `Math.random()`.
  - `data/areaValues.ts` — the real 13-area × 7-epoch VP table.
  - `data/fixtureMap.ts` — a small placeholder board so the engine and tests run
    before the full board is transcribed.
- **Tests**: vitest coverage of combat odds (exact for standard combat), seeded
  resolution, fort effects, and area/structure scoring.
- Repo-standard `build-app.sh` / `install.sh` (build → install to
  `/Applications` → relaunch with freshness proof) — present, pending first
  end-to-end validation.
